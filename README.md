Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:
## Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
## Software – Quartus prime
